WITHOUT ME , YOU CANNT FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXCUTE THE PROJECT

1. TRAIN YOUR OWN XGB MODEL WITH DATA, EXAMPLE I PROVIDE IS IN XGB_TRAIN FOLDER;

2. DUMP THE MODEL YOU TRAINED ,AND . PUT IT IN XGB_MODEL FOLDER;

3. RUN transformModel_estimatorway.py 


OHHHH, BTW , THERE IS A CUTE DEMO IN transformModel_rightway.py TO SHOW HOW TO CHANGE PYTHON CODE TO TENSORFLOW OPERATOR , THERE 
IS A EASY APPROACH TO GET TO IT! YEah....
